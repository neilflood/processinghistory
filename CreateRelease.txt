Notes on how to create a new release version

1. Ensure that all changes have been committed and pushed
2. Update the version number in processinghistory/__init__.py
3. Update the release notes (ReleaseNotes.md) to describe what
   changes are a part of this release. Go through the git logs to check
   what has changed since the last release.
4. Commit and push these changes (possibly via a separate branch & pull request)
5. Checkout a clean copy of the repository into a temp directory,
   and "cd" into it.
6. Create the tar.gz with "python -m build". This will go into
   a dist/ subdirectory
7. Go to the Github Releases page for the repo 
       https://github.com/ubarsc/processinghistory/releases
   and press "Draft a new release". You should then fill in
       Tag version: processinghistory-A.B.C
       Release Title: Version A.B.C
       Upload files: Add the tar.gz
       Click "Publish release"
